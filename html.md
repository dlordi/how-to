### There are several ways an external script can be executed:

- If `async` is present: The script is executed asynchronously with the rest of the page (the script will be executed while the page continues the parsing)
- If `async` is not present and `defer` is present: The script is executed when the page has finished parsing
- If neither `async` or `defer` is present: The script is fetched and executed immediately, before the browser continues parsing the page
