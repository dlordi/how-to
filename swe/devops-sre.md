## Differenze

1. DevOps is not a role, it is more of a cultural aspect and can't be assigned to a person, should be done as a team. However, to do DevOps, we need some tools. Whereas, SRE is the practice of creating and maintaining a highly available service and it is a role given to a software professional.

2. SREs sometimes practice DevOps. "DevOps engineer" sometimes is really just a title used to hire sysadmins. While DevOps, as considered in the organizations focuses more on the automation part, SREs focus is more on the aspects like system availability, observability, and scale considerations.

3. Ali Fay, a DevOps expert says, "A 'DevOps Engineer' is someone who not only understands the full SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle) but has the hands-on skills actually to implement changes to tooling for supporting the improved processes. Usually, those skills are honed from years of experience as a sysadmin and/or developer, allowing them to implement services using good quality code. Whereas SREs main job is ensuring the site (aka "platform/service") is always operational, no matter what."

4. When asked about the difference between SRE and DevOps, Shaun Norris, the global head of cloud infrastructure services at Standard Chartered Bank says, "I like to think that SRE is to DevOps what Scrum is to Agile; one implementation of a philosophy. Not a 100% subset (SRE doesn't subscribe to the full 'run what you build' mantra) but you get the idea…".

5. DevOps primarily focuses on empowering developers to build and manage service and give them measurable metrics to prioritize tasks. There seem to be very fewer people in this segment who can handle a senior DevOps role since It should be someone with a combination of a software engineer, system engineer, architect, and an experienced master. SRE deals with monitoring applications or services after deployment to practice where automation is crucial to improving a system's health and availability. She or he considers the role after the design work of a software developer.

DevOps and SRE can still be confusing at some level but it all depends on the company and your job profile interpretation. The roles and names might vary but the only thing that remains with you is your skills. End of the day, the whole world needs a solution and technology becoming more and more dynamic and enriching day by day, experience and learning matter more than anything else.
